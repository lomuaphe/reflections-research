I like the approach to DV literacy in this paper. I think for things to quickly fall in a system or to easily make sense to people is when there is a framework which can be easily followed.This paper proposes a framework  called educational indirectly.According to the authors the framwork would could involve structured curricula or training programs designed to impart the necessary skills and knowledge for navigating and understanding visualized data.

Additionally, the article implies the need for a critical framework for evaluating data visualizations. The authors emphasize the importance of not only being able to create visualizations but also to interpret and critically evaluate them. This suggests the necessity of developing frameworks or guidelines for assessing the quality, accuracy, and integrity of data visualizations, as well as recognizing potential biases or misleading representations.

While the article may not explicitly outline a specific framework for data visualization literacy, it underscores the importance of having structured approaches and guidelines for both teaching and evaluating data visualization skills and competencies. These frameworks would play a crucial role in advancing data literacy

in summary the authors argue that fostering data visualization literacy is crucial for empowering individuals to navigate the data-rich landscape of the 21st century, enabling them to make informed decisions, communicate effectively, and critically engage with complex information.
